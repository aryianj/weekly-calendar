# Weekly Aryian
I made a weekly calendar to share with my friends and family because I am a programmer and I can. I use Google Calendar religiously, however, I put each event in separate calendars (i.e.
work has a "Work" calendar, my college class calendars are separated by year, and so on). This is not ideal when you want to share this information with others. (Do you want to add a 
bunch of calendars you don't care about to yours? I don't!) There is probably a way to merge all of your calendars in Google Calendar but I'm lazy and it's much more fun to create my own.


## Made with...
React, Tailwind, Vite, Vercel, Figma, and love. <3
