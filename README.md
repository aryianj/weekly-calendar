# Weekly Aryian
I made a weekly calendar to share with my friends and family because I am a programmer and I can. I use Google Calendar religiously, however, I put each event in a separate calendar (i.e.
work has a "Work" calendar, my college class calendars are separated by year, and so on.) This is not ideal when you want to share this information with others. (Do you want to add a 
bunch of calendars you don't care about to yours? I don't!) There is probably a way to merge all your calendars in Google Calendar, but creating my own is much more fun.

## To Dos
1. Change it to be dynamic instead of hardcoded.
2. Create security/authorization measures so that only I can update my calendar.
3. Expand it to be a monthly/daily/weekly calendar.
4. Expand it to have more colorway options.
5. Make the time dynamic instead of hard-coding it.
~~6. Move the help/color clarifications to a separate pop-up screen to create more space for the notes.~~
7. Add a feature so friends can request a hangout.
8. Create a database for the friend request options.
9. Generate automated testing.
10. Make it responsive for tablet sizes.
11. Send alerts on Sunday to make any adjustments to your calendar.

## Made with...
React, Tailwind, Vite, Vercel, Figma, and love. <3
